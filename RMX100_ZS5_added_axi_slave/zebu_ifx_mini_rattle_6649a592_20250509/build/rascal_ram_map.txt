#  RASCAL RAM map file
#
#  The entries in this file are of the following three forms:
#
#   # comment
#   + model_num start end
#   - model_num start end
#
#  + means to include the range start..end in your memory map; start and
#  end are specified in bytes.  - means to exclude that range from your map.
#  These ranges are in addition to the base_addr and size you have already
#  specified.  start and end may have underscores in them for readability,
#  and are otherwise parsed as C integers (so can be preceded by 0x for
#  hexadecimal interpretation, or 0 for octal).
#
#  The model_num must match your memory_model_num parameter exactly
#  for the range to be relevant to the model.
#  In this example, two models are involved:
#
#   +  3   0x10_0000   0x1f_ffff
#   -  3   0x10_0100   0x10_01ff
#   + 15   0x2000_0000 0x2fff_ffff
#
#  You can use the map file instead of the priority-request feature to split
#  up memory ranges.
#
#  If an ARC build contains a Closely Coupled Memory (CCM) and a main memory
#  then there will be an overlap between these memory models. The CCM memory
#  models override the main memory models. Memory model no 0-3 (plus offset
#  for CPU number) are used for the main memory. The CCM address ranges
#  are excluded from the main memory models below:
#  

# Exclusion from main memory for the ICCM in CPUisle
# ICCM ends after 0x7ffff but wraps throughout the 0x100000-sized region.
- 0 0x0 0xfffff
- 1 0x0 0xfffff
- 2 0x0 0xfffff
- 3 0x0 0xfffff
# ICCM DMI exclusion.
- 0 0x40000000 0x4007ffff
- 1 0x40000000 0x4007ffff
- 2 0x40000000 0x4007ffff
- 3 0x40000000 0x4007ffff
# Exclusion from main memory for the DCCM in CPUisle
# DCCM ends after 0x800fffff
- 0 0x80000000 0x800fffff
- 1 0x80000000 0x800fffff
- 2 0x80000000 0x800fffff
- 3 0x80000000 0x800fffff
# DCCM DMI exclusion.
- 0 0x40100000 0x401fffff
- 1 0x40100000 0x401fffff
- 2 0x40100000 0x401fffff
- 3 0x40100000 0x401fffff
