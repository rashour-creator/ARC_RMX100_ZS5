# =========================================
# Simulator: modelsim/nc/vcs  (default: 'modelsim')
#   Which HDL simulator to use.
# Path: (default: current directory)
#   Path of the build.  The simulator may require certain configuration/support
#   files, for instance:
#     ModelSim:      modelsim.ini
#     NC-Simulator:  cds.lib, hdl.var
# Batch: off/on  (default: 'on')
#   Whether or not to run the simulator interactively (via a GUI) or
#   batch mode (non-interactively, via the-command line)
# Start: stop/run  (default: 'run')
#   Whether to immediately start the simulation as soon as the HDL simulator has
#   loaded, or allow you to interact with the simulator beforehand.
# Debug : off/number  (default: 'off')
#   Level of the trace information output by RASCAL.
# Model: board/apex  (default: 'board')
#   The system's top-level entity/module.
#   Usually 'board', but switchable for historical reasons (used to be called
#   'apex' for a core/no-memory subsystem build).
# DoFile:  (default: disabled)
#   Path or name of a simulator-specific script file.  This can contain commands
#   that the simulator will execute automatically on startup.
# User: (default: 'user')
#   Name of the working library
# Other options:
#   prop=wait_time=NNNN
#     Specify that RASCAL should wait up to NNNN cycles (default:4000)
#     for a transaction to complete.  If the transaction exceeds that,
#     RASCAL halts the RTL simulation.
#   prop=batch_mode=1
#     If the wait time is exceeded, RASCAL will no longer run the simulator.
#     This increases the chances that a debugger script using RASCAL will terminate.
#   prop=trace=1
#     Trace transactions in the RASCAL server.
#   prop=require_ram_map=1
#     If the simulation requires a backdoor memory model and file rascal_ram_map.txt
#     is missing, refuse to run the simulator.  (Requires RASCAL server 3.77.)
